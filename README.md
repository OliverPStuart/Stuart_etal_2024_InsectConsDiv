# Stuart_etal_2024_InsectConsDiv

All code used to analyse data and prepare figures for Stuart, O. et al. (2024) "Gene flow stimulates recovery of reproductive fitness in a captive bred insect." *Insect Conservation and Diversity*.  

The code is contained in the "Analysis" folder and is divided into two `.Rmd` files.

- `LHISI_Phenotype_Data_Cleaning.Rmd`: here I make some quick summaries of the phenotypic measurements taken from ZIMS and clean any obvious errors.
- `LHISI_Phenotype_Data_Modelling.Rmd`: all actual modelling and plotting goes here.

The raw data used for both of these analysis scripts is available on request: oliver.stuart93@gmail.com
